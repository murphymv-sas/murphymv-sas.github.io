## Welcome! Please see a brief description of the project below, and visit the Project Tab for the full report.  

#### On this website, you will find a recent project created by BDS-516 students at the University of Pennsylvania. For this assignment, we are interested in the comparing tweets from **Elon Musk** and **Tim Cook**. Our main research question is the following: *How do tweets from Elon Musk and Tim Cook differ?*. Before starting the research process, we hypothesize that there would be a large difference in the sentiment of tweets; that is, we postulate that tweets from Elon will contain more extreme sentiments than those from Tim. Additionally, we expect that Elon may have more tweets with pictures while also tweeting at more sproradic and unconventional times of the day in comparison to Tim.  

#### In sum, we have three hypotheses:  

#### 1. Elon will have more extreme sentiment in his tweets, compared to Tim  
#### 2. Tim will have fewer tweets with pictures/links, compared to Elon  
#### 3. Elon will have more sporadic tweeting patterns, compared to Tim
